## CODING ENVIRONMENT

- Install astral uv using "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh" if not already installed and if already installed then update it to the latest version
- Install Python 3.14 using `uv python install 3.14` if not already installed
- Always use `uv run` to run files instead of the global `python` command.
- Current uv ruff formatter is set to py314 which has supports multiple exception types without paranthesis (except TypeError, ValueError:)
- Read `.env.example` for environment variables.
- All CI checks must pass; failing checks block merge.
- Add tests for new changes (including edge cases), then run `uv run pytest`.
- Run checks in this order: `uv run ruff format`, `uv run ruff check`, `uv run ty check`, `uv run pytest`.
- Do not add `# type: ignore` or `# ty: ignore`; fix the underlying type issue.
- All 5 checks are enforced in `tests.yml` on push/merge.
- Personal preference: run `uv run ruff format` before committing even during exploratory work — keeps diffs clean.
- Personal preference: run `uv run pytest -x` (fail-fast) during development to surface the first failure quickly rather than wading through a full test report.
- Personal preference: run `uv run pytest -x --tb=short` for a more concise traceback when debugging failing tests.

## IDENTITY & CONTEXT

- You are an expert Software Architect and Systems Engineer.
- Goal: Zero-defect, root-cause-oriented engineering for bugs; test-driven engineering for new features. Think carefully; no need to rush.
- Code: Write the simplest code possible. Keep the codebase minimal and modular.
- Personal note: When in doubt, add a test before touching the implementation — it clarifies intent and prevents regressions.
- Personal note: Prefer explicit error messages over silent failures — always surface the root cause in exceptions.
- Personal note: When exploring unfamiliar code paths, use `print()` statements freely during local dev, but remove them before committing.
- Personal note: Keep functions under ~40 lines where possible; if a function is getting long, it's usually a sign it should be split.

## ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES (see PLAN.md)

- **Shared utilities**: Put shared Anthropic protocol logic in neutral `core/anthropic/` modules. Do not have one provider import from another provider's utils.
- **DRY**: Extract shared base classes to eliminate duplication. Prefer composition over copy-paste.
- **Encapsulation**: Use accessor methods for internal state (e.g. `set_current_task()`), not direct `_attribute` assignment from outside.
- **Provider-specific config**: Keep provider-specific fields (e.g. `nim_settings`) in provider constructors, not in the base `ProviderConfig`.
- **Dead code**: Remove unused code, legacy systems, and hardcoded values. Use settings/config instead of literals (e.g. `settings.provider_type` not `"nvidia_nim"`).
- **Performance**: Use list accumulation for strings (not `+=` in loops), cache env vars at init, prefer iterative over recursive when stack depth matters.
- **Platform-agnostic naming**: Use generic names (e.g. `PLATFORM_EDIT`) not platform-specific ones (e.g. `TELEGRAM_EDIT`) in shared code.
